# Whats-The-Weather

**What is it?**
App thats checks the whether for any city you like.
Save the weather for your favourite city today.

**How is it made?**
A small app I made when learning jQuery and server-client communication.
It uses Handlebars.js to render templates and jQuery ajax to fetch from an api, nothing too fancy :).
Web server uses express to expose a rest Api that is used by the client, and persists the data in mongo.
